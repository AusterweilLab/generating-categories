# Nolan Brown-bag Practice Notes
> Feb 27 2017

## Introduction

- [x] Start with an example of category generation, something to make it feel concrete and relevant.
- [x] Split up Ward alien slides to make it more digestible
- [x] Note that copy+tweak was proposed as an exemplar approach, later formalized by Jern & Kemp.
- [x] After introducing artificial paradigm, show what it means to generate a category in the space.
- [x] Note that JK13 is a prototype & probabilistic approach

## Experiment 1

- [x] Motivate more than: "replicate and see what happens!"

### Methods

- [s] _Take it slowwwwwww_
- [x] Note that it is between subjects
- [x] Show phase prompts, examples
- [ ] Again, show what it means to generate a category in the space
- [x] Bootstrap multidimensional space thinking. Note that people never saw the spaces, just squares
- [s] Show phases before conditions [contingent on strong motivation without reference to conditions].

### Results

- [x] Show samples, condition by condition. Describe main patterns and what they mean.
- [x] Foreshadow failure to replicate in XOR condition
- [x] Explain axes on within-between distance plot, highlight important upper triangle.
- [x] Do not claim people prefer the "max", just say they just prefer differences.

  
## Experiment 2

- [x] Be careful about Hidaka & Smith cite-- just attribute general idea of packing to them.
- [x] Describe JK13 predictions (no differences between conditions)
- [ ] Describe between-condition differences in heatmaps

## Modeling

- [x] Show the PACKER math for Joe [joke opportunity]. Highlight role of constraint params.
- [x] Note the recency of this information, so not much to tell yet.
- [x] Report # params per model somewhere.
- [x] Future direction combining the JK13 effect with contrast in a model.
- [x] thank Jeff <3
