# Modules

This is the directory containing custom modules for model classes and various utility functions. It can be imported by:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "../../../Modules/") # generate-categories/Modules
from models import Optimize, CopyTweak, Packer, ConjugateJK13
import utils
```

Alternative methods of importing the modules may not work (based on my experience).
