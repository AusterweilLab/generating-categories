# Generating Categories Project

This is the main repository for the generating categories project. It contains the code for the web applications for each of the experiments, the analysis for each experiment, and the modeling. 

- The `Experiments` directory contains the code and analysis of each experiment.
- The `Modules` directory contains python modules implementing generation models (and other useful functions).
- The `Manuscripts` directory contains our LaTeX manuscripts.
- The `Presentations` directory contains powerpoint slides for the talks given on the project.

### Xian to do
------
- Also explore other data (e.g. SHJ)
- ~~Get myself familiarised with how the models work.~~ _more or less familiarised now_
- Get myself familiarized with American spelling.
- Fit models to ~~A)current data (for practice), B)Nosofsky 1986, C)Nosofsky 1989 ~~ _check now the new grid search fits!_
- ~~Code up GCM (independent of CopyTweak)~~ 
- ~~Fit GCM to current, Nosofsky 1986, Nosofsky 1989~~
- Compare models
- ~~Somehow reconstructing the pickled data yields a slightly different file to the original. I've been leaving it alone for now, but it would be good to see how
  and why it's different.~~ _No noticeable differences found in data. Probably some formatting differences?_
