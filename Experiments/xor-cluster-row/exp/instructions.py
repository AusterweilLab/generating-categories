    ['training',
'In this experiment, you will observe geometric figures all belonging to a common category called "Alpha".  Examples of the Alpha category will appear one at a time, and your job is to learn as much as you can about the category.  Afterwards, we will ask you a series of questions about what you have learned.\n\nPress the spacebar when you are ready to continue.'],
    
    ['generalization',
'In this part of the experiment, you will observe more geometric figures.  Examples will appear one at a time, and your job is to decide whether each example belongs to the Alpha or Beta category.  You will not receive feedback on your responses.\n\nPress the spacebar when you are ready to continue.'],

    ['generate',
'As it turns out, there is another category of geometric figures called "Beta" that is different from the Alpha category you just learned about.  Instead of showing you examples of the Beta category, we would like to know what you think is likely to be in the Beta category. \n\nYou will now be given the chance to create examples of any size or color in order to show what you expect about the Beta category.  You will be asked to produce 4 Beta examples - they can be quite similar or quite different depending on what you think makes the most sense for the category.  Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create a repeat.\n\nPress the spacebar when you are ready to continue.'],
