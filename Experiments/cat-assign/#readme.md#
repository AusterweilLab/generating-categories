# Directory structure

Like any website, index.html is first loaded on entry.
Importantly, it loads a bunch of key variables in the
`variables.js` script. It then runs a check on the worker
(to see if it's on some banned list; see `checkworker()` in
`js/server.js`. `checkworker()` is first called in
`preview.html`) and then if it passes, the participant
details are assigned (workerId, assignment number,
condition, and counterbalance condition) and the experiment
is truly started up (`startup()` in `experiment.js`).

`startup()` loads a bunch of trial templates (the html files
in `/templates`) and starts running it, beginning with the
observation trials (`observation.js`). This also creates a
new data file (for each new participant) that is saved in
some data directory (this happens when the `savedata()`
function is run. The function is written in the server.js
file). And it also creates the stimuli
(`stimuli.make_stimuli`, which can be found in the
`stimuli.js` file)).

If this is the first time you're setting up this experiment
to run, you're going to need to set up a database in another
directory (e.g. using phpMyAdmin). Here are the
specifications:
Database name: Workers
Table: 
 - Name: Workers
 - Column1: workerId
 - Column2: Paradigm
 - Column3: UnixTime
 - Column4: Experiment
 - Column5: Stimuli

# Notes

Before publishing, remember to change these variables:

1. For each cgi file restore the first line to be `#!
/bin/python`

2. in `config.py` Restore the right path to data on server
(around line 11)

Check that conditions names match in `config.py` (line 16)
and that the counterbalance number in the next line is
appropriate

Also, remember to check where the Workers db is saved in
Luke. I'm guessing this is a list of workers we want to
block - check with Nolan.)
