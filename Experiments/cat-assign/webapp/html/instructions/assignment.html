<div id='instructions'>

<p>In this experiment, you will observe geometric figures like the ones below:</p>

<div class = 'samples'>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample1"></div>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample2"></div>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample3"></div>
	<div class = "stimsample" id = "sample4"></div>
</div>

<p>
Some figures belong to a category called "Alpha", while others belong to a category called "Beta".
The figures that you will see will appear one at a time. Each time it appears, you will be asked
which category it belongs to.
</p>
<p>
Your job is to categorize the figures as best as you can. After
you provide a response, the correct answer will be also be given as feedback. Therefore, although
you will start the experiment by guessing the categories, try your best to use the feedback after
each trial to learn as much as you can about the categories.
</p>
<p>
Some categories may be difficult to learn. However, there will be many repetitions of each
figure, so don't be disheartened if you initially get many of the categorizations incorrect.
