<p>
As it turns out, there are some geometric figures that are NOT members of the Alpha category.
Instead of showing you examples that are NOT members of the Alpha category, we would like to know what you think is likely to NOT be an Alpha.
</p>

<p>
You will now be given the chance to create examples of any size or color in order to show what you expect about examples that are NOT in the Alpha category.
You will be asked to produce <span id='ntrials'></span> examples that are NOT Alpha - they can be quite similar or quite different to each other, depending on what you think makes the most sense.
Each example needs to be unique, but the computer will let you know if you accidentally create a repeat.
