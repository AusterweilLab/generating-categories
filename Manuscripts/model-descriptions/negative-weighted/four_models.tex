\section{Generating Exemplars from Categories-by-Negation}

When generating exemplars from categories defined by a label that describes what is \emph{not} already learned, we can
define a simple model where these exemplars are samples drawn with a probability proportional to the inverse (or 1-?)category
distribution of 

An interesting property of such a model is that it assumes that categories-by-negation are multi-modal, unlike the
unimodal assumptions currently adopted by current models of category generation.
