## To-dos

### Figures
- Add representative beta samples
- Add other models to range diff gradient
- show top/bottom lines

### Misc
- be consistent about Y axis vs vertical axis

### Make these points clear
- there are very basic contrast effects that have not been explained, or even studied yet.
- these effects fall out naturally from an exemplar-based approach.
- look at our exemplar-based approach!
