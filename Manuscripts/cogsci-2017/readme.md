# CogSci 2017 Submission


jk13 and  copy and tweak are not explained until their formal intro. but we assume readers know what they are when we say:

> As such, PACKER is a significant departure from previous accounts of generation â€“ rather than propos- ing that people create categories by abstracting and re-using knowledge of related categories, PACKER first considers how the generated category should differ from related categories.

Maybe we should just remove the bit about their modeling there? We explain it in full in the modeling intros.

# Some issues with the jk13 section:

- I never dealt with $\nu_0$ and $\kappa_0$. Is setting them at 1 just like not using them at all?
- We do not describe how $\mu_B$ is inferred. this just a common knowledge thing?
